# Introduction to the E-commerce Customer Analysis Dataset

In the realm of international e-commerce, understanding customer behavior and satisfaction is crucial for success. Our project focuses on analyzing a customer database from an international e-commerce company that specializes in selling electronic products. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, we aim to extract key insights and provide valuable information to the company.

The dataset we're working with contains 10,999 observations of 12 variables, offering a comprehensive view of customer interactions and various operational aspects of the company. Each variable provides specific information about the customers and their experiences, such as warehouse block, mode of shipment, customer care calls, customer rating, cost of the product, prior purchases, product importance, gender, discount offered, weight in grams, and whether the product reached on time.

## Problem Statement

The e-commerce company aims to understand customer behavior when making purchases and assess the frequency of customer care calls. By predicting the number of calls a customer is likely to make, the company can proactively engage with customers and send timely updates about their orders, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and fostering a positive perception of the company's commitment to customer care.

By analyzing this dataset, we can provide the e-commerce company with valuable insights that will enable them to make data-driven decisions, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize their business processes.

### Objectives

1. Explore the relationship between customer ratings and product delivery timeliness.
2. Analyze the impact of customer care calls on customer satisfaction and repeat purchases.
3. Investigate the influence of product cost and offered discounts on customer behavior.
4. Predict the number of customer care calls based on various customer and transactional factors.
5. Identify the key factors that contribute to higher or lower call volumes.
6. Provide recommendations to optimize customer care strategies and improve overall customer experience.
